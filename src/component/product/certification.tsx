        <h1 className='font-bold text-3xl pt-6 mb-3'>ORAL POWDER</h1>
        <p className="text-lg">Oral powders are preparations consisting of solid, loose, dry particles of varying degrees of fineness. They contain one or more active ingredients, with or without excipients and, if necessary, authorized colouring matter and flavouring substances. They are generally administered in or with water or another suitable liquid. They may also be swallowed directly. They are presented as single-dose or multidose preparations. Each dose of a single-dose powder is enclosed in an individual container, for example a packet, a sachet or a vial. Multidose oral powders require the provision of a measuring device capable of delivering the quantity prescribed.</p>
        <h1 className='font-bold text-3xl pt-6 mb-3'>ORAL LIQUID AND EXTERNAL LIQUID</h1>
        <p className="text-lg"> className="text-lg"The oral use of liquid pharmaceuticals has generally been justified on the basis of ease of administration to those who have difficulty in swallowing solid dosage forms. A drug administered in solution is immediately available for absorption and in most case, is more rapidly and efficiently absorbed than the same amount of drug administered in a tablet or capsules</p>

        <h1 className='font-bold text-3xl pt-6 mb-3'>EXTERNAL SEMI-SOLID (OINTMENT&CREAM)</h1>
        <p className="text-lg">Pharmaceutical preparations for treatment of conditions such as rashes, skin irritation, stings, fungal infections, etc. are normally supplied in the form of a cream or ointment as this provides an effective means of delivering the active ingredient directly to the required area. Products can be either a water in oil (w/o) or oil in water (o/w) emulsion, consisting of waxes, emollients and lubricants dispersed in an oil phase, and a water phase containing emulsifying, stabilizing and thickening agents, preservatives and in some cases, colorant. Active ingredients are dispersed in either phase or added when the emulsion has been formed and allowed to cool.</p>
        <h1 className='font-bold text-3xl pt-6 mb-3'>SMALL VOLUME PARENTERALS</h1>
        <p className="text-lg">Parenteral Preparations are the preparations intended for administration by injections, infusions or implementations into body and directly injected into veins, muscles, under the skin or more specialized tissue such as spinal cord. These are sterile and pyrogen free liquids or solid dosage forms and may contain one or more active ingredients. Parenteral preparations may require the use of excipients such as solvents, substances to enhance solubility, suspending agents, buffering agents, substances to make the preparation isotonic with blood, stabilizers or antimicrobial preservatives. The addition of excipients is kept to a minimum. When excipients are used they do not adversely affect the stability, bioavailability, safety or efficacy of the active ingredient(s), or cause toxicity or undue local irritation. There must be no incompatibility between any of the components of the dosage form. Parenteral Preparations require sterile pyrogen free atmosphere.</p>

        <h1 className='font-bold text-3xl pt-6 mb-3'>TABLETS</h1>
        <p className="text-lg">A tablet is a pharmaceutical oral dosage form or solid unit dosage form. Tablets may be defined as the solid unit dosage form of medicament or medicaments with suitable excipients. It comprises a mixture of active substances and excipients, usually in powder form, pressed or compacted from a powder into a solid dose. Tablets are simple and convenient to use. They provide an accurately measured dosage of the active ingredient in a convenient portable package, and can be designed to protect unstable medications or disguise unpalatable ingredients. Colored coatings, embossed markings and printing can be used to aid tablet recognition.</p>
